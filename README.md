### TCPChatRoom

I'm refreshing my Python skills with a focus on Security/Network related projects.

* Making a TCP Chat Room to practice Python networking skills
* Part of the Network Programming with Python Course on freeCodeCamp.org -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdiSJakIS4
* https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html

### Executing program

* Make sure to keep this as local host and use a dynamic port
```
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 55555

```
